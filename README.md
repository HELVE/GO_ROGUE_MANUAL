# GO ROGUE! - Manual On Creative Processes & Methods
```
Dive into chaos, come out enlightened!"
```
Go Rogue is an essay on creative processes and methodologies that can be used throughout a variety of industries and apply to  every individual willing to take his progress into their hands. 

the project template framework created for the purpose of unifying project structure across various types of endeavours and streamline the flow of information and data making it easier to nagivate and progress. Naming of the template comes from Latin word 'vacō' which translates into 'I am void'.

Chapters:
- Go into chaos to create your own order.
- Dopamine Trails - optimization
- "War between monotony and novelty, between stasis and creativity and in this war our side (human side) is not destined to lose." "Human life without novelty is a life without creativity, without progress. It's a static society, a zero-sum game" - David Deutsch

Notes and quotes below could potentially go into Dopamine Trails philosophical foundation rather than this book.
---
- EXPLAINING THE SUFFERING IN ANCIENT TIMES - lack of progress, lack of real solution. "Suffering is intimately related to staticity because staticity isn't just frustrating -all source of suffering like famine, pandemics, incoming asteroids, war and slavery hurt people only until we've created a knowledge to prevent them" (or even just a new perspective). It was different way of processing ideas, they didn't look for alternatives, simplified, no physical reasons needed to exist to explain something.
- back in the day used to be a war between good and evil, then it became chaos/entropy vs order in 20th Century. "Contemporary take on good and evil is a local battle between sustainability and wastefullness." Order vs entropy in this perspective is even bleaker than good vs evil - "the villain is preordained to have the final victory."
- now it is gravity (collapsing universe) vs dark energy (shredding the universe)
- in this struggle human is never portrayed accurately - we are always the ones subjugated and hopeless.
- Jake Abernovsky "Man is not a figure in the landscape, he is the shaper of the landscape" but we are not the rulers of cosmic forces, we the their users. what creates novelty? (why create, why experiment? origin of Helve AVR, a war against staticity)
- novelty was created with big bang. then at some point it vanished from the universe 12-13 billion years ago
