# GO ROGUE! - Manual On Creative Processes & Methods
```
Dive into chaos, come out enlightened!"
```
Go Rogue is an essay on creative processes and methodologies that can be used throughout a variety of industries and apply to  every individual willing to take his progress into their hands. 

Coming up with ideas, the way a person manages to make the connections between concepts in their mind is a completely unique experience for every single human being. It is based on your life's timeline, your personal experiences that literally only happened to you in a very specific way and noone else apart from you can see them for what they truly are and what they mean in the grand scheme of things. We ourselves often come to realizations about our behaviour long time after the momment has passed. 

Find your own methodology/approach.

Creative methodology therefore cannot rely fully on some standarized notions and frameworks. Arguing about methods to approach various creative problems is basically only process of optimization, not a full A to B destination guide. One can obviously try to copy mechanisms and chains of causality to try to apply them to their own workflow but it will always stay unique to you and only you in the end as you are applying and modifying these patterns to your liking and preference in the end.

Go Rogue Creative Manual gives you a possibility of optimization and gives you a framework to think about your own processes not in a collective sense but in a very personal and intimate way.

If one takes up the road of creativity it becomes one's responsibility to figure out how to work with their unique "stats".

Optimizing your life for only one objective is a beautiful thing but very dangerous. "Failing" something you devoted your entire life to can be a very emotional and devastating time. To avoid that make sure to have a backup always - or develop a couple of projects under the hood so you have something to fall back to instead of wallowing in self-pity.

Similarly you can apply this notion to always having one foot in knowledge (competence) while the other is in chaos and experimentation. See, both feet in order makes you complacent. Both feet in chaos is too much. Mind in the cloud, feet on the ground.

Technology as a tool, not an end to itself. People often focus on the technology more than on the idea when working on project. They are afraid that the "quality" will be below standards. Let me tell you something - quality is entirely subjective. Eye of the beholder and all that. 

Chapters:
- Go into chaos to create your own order.
- Dopamine Trails - optimization

> "War between monotony and novelty, between stasis and creativity and in this war our side (human side) is not destined to lose." "Human life without novelty is a life without creativity, without progress. It's a static society, a zero-sum game" - David Deutsch

> All problem solvers and problem inventors have had the experience of thinking, and then overthinking, themselves into a dead end. The question we’ve all encountered—and, inevitably, will encounter again—is how to get things moving and keep them moving. That is, how to get unstuck.

trigger aspect to think about:

> For me, the quest for a breakthrough often requires getting myself into literal motion; one small step for Poincaré but a whole sequence of steps for me. I’ll take a long hike, during which my mind has nothing to worry about except putting one foot in front of the other, or I’ll go for a long drive, so that my primary focus is on the road. Maybe it’s the endorphins, or maybe it’s refocussing my attention on some other activity which enables a new idea. Perhaps it is the momentary feeling of being untethered that gives the mind free rein—the space to have a good idea.

> The key here isn’t fitness—it’s just a feeling of being free, of forgetting for a moment that we are bound by gravity and logic and convention, of letting the magic happen. For me, perhaps it’s that my ideas just need to be jostled into the right place. Jogging jogs them. But there are mathematicians who try to alter their brain chemistry a little more directly. The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős was notoriously prolific, someone to whom the magic tricks seemed to come enviably easily. So, what was his secret? His friend Alfréd Rényi, a fellow-Hungarian, once said, “a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.” And both men were caffeine enthusiasts. But Erdős was a person of extremes, and he also fuelled his ideas through a don’t-try-this-at-home technique: he used stimulants such as Ritalin and Benzedrine for much of his career. At one point, a friend, worried about Erdős’s health, challenged him to go off the drugs for a month, and Erdős agreed, but when the experiment was over he said that, on the whole, mathematics had been set back by his weeks of relative indolence.

> Whereas Erdős sought hyper-focussed vigilance, other eminent mathematicians have found a hazy drowsiness to be the most fertile state of mind. Poincaré described lying in bed in a half-dream state as the ideal condition for coming up with new ideas. The philosopher and mathematician René Descartes famously loved to lounge in bed in the morning and think (I suppose to give evidence that he was). It was on one such morning—as the story goes—while dreamily watching the path of a fly flitting around on the ceiling, that he came up with the xy plane of Cartesian coordinates.


Notes and quotes below could potentially go into Dopamine Trails philosophical foundation rather than this book.

- EXPLAINING THE SUFFERING IN ANCIENT TIMES - lack of progress, lack of real solution. "Suffering is intimately related to staticity because staticity isn't just frustrating -all source of suffering like famine, pandemics, incoming asteroids, war and slavery hurt people only until we've created a knowledge to prevent them" (or even just a new perspective). It was different way of processing ideas, they didn't look for alternatives, simplified, no physical reasons needed to exist to explain something.
- back in the day used to be a war between good and evil, then it became chaos/entropy vs order in 20th Century. "Contemporary take on good and evil is a local battle between sustainability and wastefullness." Order vs entropy in this perspective is even bleaker than good vs evil - "the villain is preordained to have the final victory."
- now it is gravity (collapsing universe) vs dark energy (shredding the universe)
- in this struggle human is never portrayed accurately - we are always the ones subjugated and hopeless.
- Jake Abernovsky "Man is not a figure in the landscape, he is the shaper of the landscape" but we are not the rulers of cosmic forces, we the their users. what creates novelty? (why create, why experiment? origin of Helve AVR, a war against staticity)
- novelty was created with big bang. then at some point it vanished from the universe 12-13 billion years ago until now.
Until now it was the Era of Great Monotony (of novelty). There was an event tho, origin of life coding for the biological adaptations, building DNA repositories. Coding for novelty. Experimentation. Then explanatory knowledge in humans arrived as a defining adaptation of our species.
- powerful things affect strongly the lesser things not the other way around. The Hierarchy Rule. Causing a large scale simplicity has caused The Great Monotony. but is not the rule of nature here because the Hierarchy has been violated and reversed. Humans are the ultimate agents of novelty for universe. The only way to fight The Great Monotony is constant creation and experimentation. It is the modern era of Antropocen.
